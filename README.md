## About
- In progress :)
- This project was made to find movies to watch! 
- Shuffle, search by genre, pick a random movie, etc.
- I created this app to learn how to make a React app served on Golang.

## Technologies
- React - version 17.0.2
- Golang - version 1.17.6

## Setup
- Once cloned open up your terminal.
``` 
$ cd ./find-a-movie
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
- Open a seperate terminal instance and run 
```
$ go run main.go
```
- Acquire API key, open up `apiKey.example.js` and rename to `apiKey.js`
- Replace the empty apiKey string to your API key. 
- `module.exports.apiKey = "xxxxxxx";`
- And you're all set!
