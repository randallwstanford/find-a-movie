## About
- ðŸ‘€ This project was made to find movies to watch! 
- ðŸ”Ž Search movie by title, by random, and or by popular.
- ðŸ§  I created this app to learn how to make a React app served on Golang.
- âœ¨ I wanted to better style it but I hit the API limit for the month, so ill wait until the month is over to come back and make it prettier!

## Technologies
- React - version 17.0.2
- Golang - version 1.17.6
- Webpack - version 5.68.0
- Axios - version 0.25.0
- [Movies/TVShows Data (IMDB) API](https://rapidapi.com/amrelrafie/api/movies-tvshows-data-imdb/details?utm_source=api-quota-85&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Movies%2FTVShows%20Data%20%28IMDB%29)

## Setup
- Once cloned open up your terminal.
``` 
$ cd ./find-a-movie
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```
